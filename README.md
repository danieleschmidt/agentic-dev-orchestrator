A CLI and GitHub Action that unifies multi-agent development workflows, integrating frameworks like AutoGen and CrewAI. It streamlines the coding process by automatically ranking tasks from a backlog using the Weighted Shortest Job First (WSJF) method and executing them through a sequence of specialized AI agents.

## ‚ú® Key Features

*   **WSJF-Ranked Backlog**: Ingests `backlog/*.json` files, prioritizing tasks using the full SAFe WSJF formula: `(User-Business Value + Time Criticality + Risk Reduction & Opportunity Enablement) / Job Size`.
*   **Multi-Agent Execution Graph**: Implements a pipeline of AI agents‚ÄîPlanner, Coder, Reviewer, and Merger‚Äîusing AutoGen's communication channels.
*   **Safety & Escalation Hooks**: Includes a policy gate, unit-test coverage checks, and a human-in-the-loop pattern for resolving edge cases. This pattern is implemented via AutoGen's `UserProxyAgent`.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture
