# AUTONOMOUS SDLC ENHANCEMENT - DEPLOYMENT INSTRUCTIONS
## Ready-to-Deploy CI/CD Infrastructure

**Repository**: Agentic Development Orchestrator (ADO)  
**Status**: ✅ **READY FOR IMMEDIATE DEPLOYMENT**  
**Implementation**: Complete with manual deployment required due to GitHub security restrictions  

---

## 🚨 IMPORTANT: Manual Deployment Required

Due to GitHub security restrictions, GitHub Apps cannot create workflow files directly. However, **all implementation work is complete** and ready for immediate deployment.

### 📋 **DEPLOYMENT CHECKLIST**

#### Step 1: Copy Workflow Files (5-10 minutes)
The workflow files are ready in your local `.github/workflows/` directory. Copy them to your repository:

```bash
# All files are ready in .github/workflows/
├── ci.yml                    # Complete CI pipeline
├── security.yml              # Security scanning automation  
├── release.yml               # Release management
├── dependency-update.yml     # Dependency automation
└── codeql.yml                # Advanced static analysis
```

**Action Required**: Copy these 5 files to your repository's `.github/workflows/` directory.

#### Step 2: Configure Repository Secrets (5 minutes)
Navigate to **Repository Settings > Secrets and Variables > Actions**:

**Required Secrets:**
- `PYPI_API_TOKEN`: For automated package publishing
- `GITHUB_TOKEN`: Auto-generated (verify permissions)

**Optional Secrets:**
- `CODECOV_TOKEN`: For coverage reporting integration

#### Step 3: Enable Branch Protection (5 minutes)
Navigate to **Repository Settings > Branches**:

1. Add protection rule for `main` branch
2. Enable: ✅ Require PR reviews ✅ Require status checks ✅ Include administrators
3. Required status checks: `quality-checks`, `security-scan`, `test`, `build-verification`

#### Step 4: Enable GitHub Advanced Security (2 minutes)
Navigate to **Repository Settings > Security & Analysis**:
- ✅ Enable CodeQL analysis
- ✅ Enable secret scanning  
- ✅ Enable Dependabot alerts
