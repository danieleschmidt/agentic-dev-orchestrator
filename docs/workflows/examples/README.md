# GitHub Actions Workflow Examples

This directory contains example GitHub Actions workflow files that should be manually copied to `.github/workflows/` directory by repository maintainers.

## üö® Important: Manual Setup Required

Due to GitHub App permission limitations, these workflow files **cannot be automatically created**. Repository maintainers must manually copy these files to the `.github/workflows/` directory.

**Purpose**: Automates dependency updates with security and compatibility checks.

**Features**:
- üîÑ Automated Python dependency updates (patch/minor/major)
- üéØ GitHub Actions version updates
- üîê Security vulnerability detection
- üìã Dependency review for pull requests
- üö® Automatic security issue creation
- üìä Comprehensive change reporting

**Triggers**:
- Weekly scheduled updates (Monday 9 AM UTC)
- Manual workflow dispatch with update type selection

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions

### 1. Copy Workflow Files
```bash
# Create workflows directory if it doesn't exist
mkdir -p .github/workflows

# Copy all example workflows
cp docs/workflows/examples/*.yml .github/workflows/
```

### 2. Configure Repository Secrets

#### Required Secrets:
```bash
# PyPI Publishing
PYPI_API_TOKEN=your_pypi_token
TEST_PYPI_API_TOKEN=your_test_pypi_token

# Security Scanning (Optional)
SEMGREP_APP_TOKEN=your_semgrep_token
SNYK_TOKEN=your_snyk_token
GITLEAKS_LICENSE=your_gitleaks_license

# Additional tokens are automatically provided by GitHub
GITHUB_TOKEN  # Automatically provided
```

### 3. Configure Repository Settings

#### Branch Protection Rules:
1. Navigate to Settings > Branches
2. Add rule for `main` branch:
   - ‚úÖ Require a pull request before merging
   - ‚úÖ Require approvals (minimum 1)
   - ‚úÖ Dismiss stale PR approvals when new commits are pushed
   - ‚úÖ Require status checks to pass before merging
   - ‚úÖ Require branches to be up to date before merging
   - ‚úÖ Include administrators

#### Required Status Checks:
- `Run Tests`
- `Security Scanning`
- `Build Package`
- `Build Docker Image`

### 4. Environment Configuration

#### Production Environment:
1. Navigate to Settings > Environments
2. Create "production" environment
3. Configure protection rules:
   - ‚úÖ Required reviewers
   - ‚úÖ Wait timer (optional)
   - ‚úÖ Deployment branches (tags and main only)

## üîß Customization Guide

### Modifying Python Versions
Edit the matrix strategy in `ci.yml`:
```yaml
strategy:
  matrix:
    python-version: ["3.9", "3.10", "3.11", "3.12"]  # Modify as needed
```

### Adding Additional Security Tools
Extend the security workflow by adding new steps:
```yaml
- name: Custom Security Tool
  run: |
    custom-security-tool --scan .
```

### Customizing Deployment Targets
Modify the publishing steps in `cd.yml`:
```yaml
- name: Deploy to Custom Registry
  run: |
    # Custom deployment logic
```

### Adjusting Update Schedules
Modify the cron expressions:
```yaml
schedule:
  - cron: '0 9 * * 1'  # Weekly Monday 9 AM UTC
  - cron: '0 6 * * *'  # Daily 6 AM UTC
```

## üìä Monitoring and Observability

### Workflow Artifacts
Each workflow generates artifacts for analysis:
- **CI**: Test results, coverage reports, build artifacts
- **CD**: Distribution packages, SBOMs, deployment logs
- **Security**: Vulnerability reports, SARIF files, compliance reports
- **Dependencies**: Audit reports, update summaries

### GitHub Security Integration
- SARIF files are automatically uploaded to GitHub Security tab
- Dependency vulnerabilities appear in the Insights > Dependency graph
- Security advisories trigger automated issue creation

### Notifications
- Deployment status notifications in workflow summaries
- Security issue creation for critical vulnerabilities
- Pull request comments for dependency review failures

## üöÄ Advanced Features

### Parallel Execution
Workflows are optimized for parallel execution:
- CI jobs run in parallel where possible
- Security scans execute concurrently
- Multi-platform builds are parallelized

### Caching Strategy
Efficient caching reduces execution time:
- pip dependency caching
- Docker layer caching
- GitHub Actions cache optimization

### Error Handling
Robust error handling and recovery:
- Conditional execution based on previous job results
- Graceful handling of optional security tools
- Comprehensive failure reporting

## üìã Maintenance

### Regular Updates
- Review and update workflow versions monthly
- Monitor GitHub Actions marketplace for new tools
- Update security scanning tools and configurations
- Review and adjust branch protection rules

### Performance Optimization
- Monitor workflow execution times
- Optimize caching strategies
- Review artifact retention policies
- Consider workflow concurrency limits

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Permission Errors**: Ensure GITHUB_TOKEN has sufficient permissions
2. **Secret Errors**: Verify all required secrets are configured
3. **Test Failures**: Check test dependencies and Python version compatibility
4. **Security Scan Failures**: Review security tool configurations

### Debug Mode
Enable debug logging by setting repository secret:
```
ACTIONS_STEP_DEBUG=true
```
