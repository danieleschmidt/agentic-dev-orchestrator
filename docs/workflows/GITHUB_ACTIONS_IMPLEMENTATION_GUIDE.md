# GitHub Actions Implementation Guide

## Overview

This guide provides complete GitHub Actions workflow templates for implementing enterprise-grade CI/CD pipeline for the agentic-dev-orchestrator repository.

## Critical Missing Workflows

### 1. Main CI Pipeline (.github/workflows/ci.yml)

```yaml
name: CI Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main, develop ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        python-version: [3.8, 3.9, "3.10", 3.11, 3.12]
    
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4
    
    - name: Set up Python ${{ matrix.python-version }}
      uses: actions/setup-python@v4
      with:
        python-version: ${{ matrix.python-version }}
    
    - name: Cache dependencies
      uses: actions/cache@v3
      with:
        path: ~/.cache/pip
        key: ${{ runner.os }}-pip-${{ hashFiles('**/requirements*.txt', 'pyproject.toml') }}
        restore-keys: |
          ${{ runner.os }}-pip-
    
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        python -m pip install --upgrade pip
        pip install -e .[dev,all]
    
    - name: Run linting
      run: |
        ruff check .
        black --check .
        mypy .
    
    - name: Run tests with coverage

        pytest --cov=. --cov-report=xml --cov-report=term-missing
    
    - name: Upload coverage to Codecov
      uses: codecov/codecov-action@v3

    - name: Run Safety dependency scan
      run: |
        safety check --json --output safety-report.json
        safety check
    
    - name: Run pip-audit

      interval: "weekly"
      day: "monday"
      time: "06:00"
    open-pull-requests-limit: 10
    reviewers:
      - "maintainer-team"
    assignees:
      - "security-team"
    commit-message:
      prefix: "deps"
      include: "scope"
    labels:
      - "dependencies"
      - "security"
    
  - package-ecosystem: "docker"
    directory: "/"
    schedule:
      interval: "weekly"
    labels:
      - "docker"
      - "security"
    
  - package-ecosystem: "github-actions"
    directory: "/.github/workflows"
    schedule:

```

## Implementation Checklist

### Phase 1: Core CI/CD (Week 1)
- [ ] Create `.github/workflows/` directory
- [ ] Implement main CI pipeline with matrix testing
- [ ] Set up code coverage reporting
- [ ] Configure branch protection rules

### Phase 2: Security Integration (Week 2)
- [ ] Implement security scanning workflow
- [ ] Set up CodeQL analysis
- [ ] Configure container security scanning
- [ ] Enable security advisory monitoring

### Phase 3: SLSA Compliance (Week 3)
- [ ] Implement SLSA Level 3 build provenance
- [ ] Automate SBOM generation
- [ ] Set up artifact signing
- [ ] Configure release automation

### Phase 4: Dependency Management (Week 4)
- [ ] Configure Dependabot
- [ ] Set up automated security updates
- [ ] Implement dependency vulnerability alerts
- [ ] Configure pull request automation

## Security Considerations

### Secrets Management
Required GitHub Secrets:
- `CODECOV_TOKEN`: For coverage reporting
- `SECURITY_ALERTS_TOKEN`: For security notifications
- `CONTAINER_REGISTRY_TOKEN`: For container publishing

### Permissions
Configure least-privilege access:
- Read access for standard checks
- Write access only for artifact uploads
- Security-events write for SARIF uploads

### Branch Protection
Recommended branch protection rules:
- Require status checks to pass
- Require branches to be up to date
- Require review from code owners
- Restrict pushes to main branch

## Performance Optimization

### Caching Strategy
- Cache pip dependencies
- Cache Docker layers
- Cache build artifacts
- Use matrix parallelization

### Resource Management
- Use ubuntu-latest for consistency
- Implement timeout limits
- Monitor action execution costs
- Optimize for critical path

## Monitoring and Alerting

### CI/CD Metrics
Track key performance indicators:
- Build success rate
- Average build time
- Security scan results
- Test coverage trends

### Alerting Setup
Configure notifications for:
- Build failures
- Security vulnerabilities
- Dependency updates
- Performance regressions

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Create GitHub Actions workflows using templates above
2. **Week 1**: Test and validate all pipelines
3. **Week 2**: Integrate with existing tooling
4. **Week 3**: Fine-tune performance and security
5. **Ongoing**: Monitor and optimize based on usage patterns

This implementation will elevate the repository to enterprise-grade CI/CD standards while maintaining the excellent foundation already established.
