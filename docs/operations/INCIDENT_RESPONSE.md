## Overview

This incident response plan provides structured procedures for identifying, responding to, and recovering from incidents affecting the ADO system. The goal is to minimize impact, restore normal operations quickly, and prevent future occurrences.

### Incident Definition

An incident is any unplanned interruption or reduction in quality of ADO services that affects:
- Agent execution pipeline
- GitHub integration functionality
- WSJF prioritization accuracy
- User access to ADO CLI
- Data integrity or security

## Incident Classification

### Severity Levels

#### **Critical (P0)**
- **Impact**: Complete system outage or data loss
- **Examples**:
  - ADO CLI completely non-functional
  - Agent pipeline causing data corruption
  - Security breach or credential exposure
  - GitHub token compromised
- **Response Time**: Immediate (< 15 minutes)
- **Resolution Target**: 2 hours

#### **High (P1)**
- **Impact**: Major functionality impaired, multiple users affected
- **Examples**:
  - Agent pipeline failing consistently
  - WSJF calculations producing incorrect results
  - GitHub PR creation failing
  - Performance degradation > 50%
- **Response Time**: 30 minutes
- **Resolution Target**: 4 hours

#### **Medium (P2)**

## Escalation Procedures

### Automatic Escalation Triggers

1. **Time-based Escalation**:
   - P0: Escalate to EM after 1 hour
   - P1: Escalate to EM after 2 hours
   - P2: Escalate to EM after 8 hours

2. **Impact-based Escalation**:
   - Multiple customers affected
   - Revenue impact identified
   - Security implications discovered
   - Media attention potential

3. **Technical Escalation**:
   - Root cause unclear after initial investigation
   - Fix requires significant architectural changes
   - Third-party vendor involvement needed

### Escalation Chain

```
L1: On-call Engineer
  ↓ (15 min for P0, 30 min for P1)
L2: Technical Lead + Incident Commander
  ↓ (1 hour for P0, 2 hours for P1)
L3: Engineering Manager
  ↓ (2 hours for P0, 4 hours for P1)
L4: CTO
  ↓ (4 hours for P0, 8 hours for P1)
L5: CEO
```

   slack create-channel #incident-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M)
   
   # Page on-call engineer
   pagerduty trigger --severity high --summary "ADO Incident"
   
   # Initial system assessment
   ado health-check --full
   kubectl get pods -n ado-production
   ```

3. **Incident Declaration**
   - Create incident ticket
   - Notify response team
   - Set up communication channels

### Investigation Phase

1. **Gather Information**
   ```bash
   # Check system status
   ado status --verbose
   
   # Review recent deployments
   git log --oneline --since="2 hours ago"
   
   # Check monitoring dashboards
   curl -X GET "https://monitoring.terragon.com/api/incidents/current"
   
   # Analyze logs
   kubectl logs -n ado-production -l app=ado --tail=1000
   ```

2. **Impact Assessment**
   - Affected user count
   - Service availability percentage
   - Revenue impact estimation
   - Data integrity verification

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
