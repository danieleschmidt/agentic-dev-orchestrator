# ADR-002: Agent Pipeline Architecture

## Status
Accepted

## Context

The system needs to process backlog items through multiple stages of work: planning, implementation, review, and integration. Several architectural patterns were considered for coordinating this workflow:

1. **Monolithic Agent**: Single agent handles all aspects
2. **Event-Driven Architecture**: Agents communicate via events/messages
3. **Pipeline Architecture**: Sequential agent processing with handoffs
4. **Workflow Engine**: External orchestration tool manages agent coordination
5. **Microservices**: Independent agent services with API communication

The system must be:
- Reliable and fault-tolerant
- Easy to debug and monitor
- Extensible for new agent types
- Suitable for autonomous operation

## Decision

We will implement a **Pipeline Architecture** with sequential agent processing and explicit handoffs between specialized agents.

**Agent Pipeline Structure:**
```
Backlog Item → Planner Agent → Coder Agent → Reviewer Agent → Merger Agent
                     ↓              ↓             ↓             ↓
                [Plan Artifact] [Code Changes] [Review Result] [PR/Deploy]
                                                      ↓
                                            [UserProxy Agent] (on escalation)
```

**Agent Responsibilities:**

1. **Planner Agent**
   - Analyzes backlog items and creates implementation plans
   - Breaks down complex requirements into actionable steps
   - Identifies dependencies and technical constraints

2. **Coder Agent** 
   - Implements code changes based on planner specifications
   - Generates tests and documentation
   - Follows coding standards and best practices

3. **Reviewer Agent**
   - Performs automated code review and quality checks
   - Runs tests and security scans
   - Decides whether to approve or escalate

4. **Merger Agent**
   - Creates pull requests and manages Git operations
   - Coordinates with CI/CD systems
   - Handles deployment processes

5. **UserProxy Agent**
   - Handles human-in-the-loop scenarios
   - Manages escalations and manual interventions
   - Provides fallback for complex decisions

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Clear Separation of Concerns**: Each agent has a specific, well-defined role
- **Linear Flow**: Easy to understand and debug the processing sequence
- **Fault Isolation**: Issues in one agent don't directly affect others
- **Incremental Processing**: Work products are preserved at each stage
- **Specialized Expertise**: Agents can be optimized for their specific tasks
- **Easy Testing**: Each agent can be tested independently
- **Audit Trail**: Clear record of processing at each stage

### Negative
- **Sequential Bottleneck**: Failure in one agent blocks the entire pipeline
- **Increased Latency**: Multiple handoffs add processing time
- **State Management**: Need to persist and pass context between agents
- **Complexity**: More moving parts than a monolithic approach
- **Resource Usage**: Multiple agent instances consume more resources

## Alternatives Considered

### 1. Monolithic Agent
- **Pros**: Simple architecture, no coordination complexity
- **Cons**: Difficult to maintain, hard to optimize individual capabilities, poor fault isolation

### 2. Event-Driven Architecture
- **Pros**: High decoupling, good scalability, resilient to failures
- **Cons**: Complex debugging, eventual consistency issues, requires message broker

### 3. Workflow Engine (e.g., Airflow, Temporal)
- **Pros**: Robust orchestration, visual workflow management, battle-tested
- **Cons**: Additional infrastructure dependency, learning curve, overkill for current needs

### 4. Microservices with APIs
- **Pros**: Language-agnostic, independent scaling, technology diversity
- **Cons**: Network complexity, service discovery, distributed system challenges

### 5. State Machine Pattern
- **Pros**: Clear state transitions, formal verification possible
- **Cons**: Complex state management, difficult to extend, rigid structure

## Implementation Details

### Agent Communication Protocol
Agents communicate through structured artifacts passed via the filesystem:

```python
@dataclass
class AgentArtifact:
    agent_type: str
    timestamp: str
    item_id: str
    status: str  # success|failure|escalation
    data: Dict[str, Any]
    next_agent: Optional[str]
```

### Error Handling and Recovery
- **Graceful Degradation**: Agents attempt recovery before escalation
- **Retry Logic**: Configurable retry attempts with exponential backoff
- **Circuit Breaker**: Prevent cascading failures from external services
- **Human Escalation**: UserProxy agent handles complex scenarios

### Monitoring and Observability
- **Pipeline Metrics**: Track processing time and success rates per agent
- **Artifact Logging**: Log all agent inputs and outputs for debugging
- **Health Checks**: Monitor agent availability and performance
- **Alerting**: Notify on pipeline failures or excessive escalations

### Extensibility
The pipeline architecture supports easy addition of new agents:
- **Plugin Architecture**: Agents implement standard interface
- **Configuration-Driven**: Pipeline order defined in configuration
- **Conditional Routing**: Agents can specify next agent based on results

### Example Agent Implementation
```python
class BaseAgent:
    def process(self, artifact: AgentArtifact) -> AgentArtifact:
        """Process input artifact and return result"""
        pass
    
    def can_handle(self, item: BacklogItem) -> bool:
        """Check if agent can process this item type"""
        pass
    
    def escalate(self, reason: str, context: Dict) -> None:
        """Escalate to human intervention"""
        pass
```

This architecture provides a solid foundation for autonomous development operations while maintaining flexibility for future enhancements.
