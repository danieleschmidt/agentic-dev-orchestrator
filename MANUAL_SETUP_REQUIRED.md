# Manual Setup Required

Due to GitHub's security restrictions on automated workflow creation, some setup steps require manual intervention.

## ðŸš¨ Critical: GitHub Actions Setup

The GitHub Actions workflows could not be automatically created due to security permissions. Please complete this setup manually:

### 1. Copy Workflow Files

```bash
# From the repository root
mkdir -p .github/workflows
cp github-workflows-template/*.yml .github/workflows/
```

### 2. Configure Repository Secrets

In your GitHub repository settings â†’ Secrets and variables â†’ Actions:

**Required for releases:**
- `PYPI_API_TOKEN`: Your PyPI API token for publishing packages
- `CODECOV_TOKEN`: (Optional) For code coverage reporting

**Automatically provided:**
- `GITHUB_TOKEN`: GitHub automatically provides this

### 3. Enable Actions

1. Go to repository Settings â†’ Actions â†’ General
2. Ensure "Allow all actions and reusable workflows" is selected
3. Save permissions

### 4. Create Release Environment (Optional)

For enhanced security:
1. Go to Settings â†’ Environments
2. Create new environment named "release"
3. Add `PYPI_API_TOKEN` as environment secret
4. Configure deployment protection rules as needed

## âœ… Completed Automatically

The following enhancements were successfully implemented:

- âœ… **Shell Completions**: Bash, Zsh, Fish completions in `completions/` directory
- âœ… **Installation Script**: `install-completions.sh` for easy setup
- âœ… **Documentation**: `QUICKSTART.md` and updated README
- âœ… **URL Fixes**: Updated GitHub repository URLs and badges
- âœ… **Distribution**: `MANIFEST.in` for complete package distribution
- âœ… **Analysis**: `SDLC_ANALYSIS.md` with context-specific recommendations

## ðŸ”„ Next Steps After Manual Setup

1. **Test the workflows:**
   ```bash
   git add .github/workflows/
   git commit -m "Add GitHub Actions workflows"
   git push
   ```

2. **Verify CI pipeline:**
   - Check the Actions tab in your GitHub repository
   - Ensure all tests pass

3. **Test release process:**
   ```bash
   git tag v0.1.1
   git push origin v0.1.1
   ```

4. **Install and test shell completions:**
   ```bash
   ./install-completions.sh
   # Restart your shell, then test:
   ado <TAB><TAB>
   ```

## ðŸ“‹ Verification Checklist

- [ ] GitHub Actions workflows copied and committed
- [ ] Repository secrets configured
- [ ] Actions enabled in repository settings  
- [ ] CI pipeline runs successfully on push
- [ ] Release process tested with a tag
- [ ] Shell completions installed and working
- [ ] Package builds and installs correctly

## ðŸ†˜ Troubleshooting

**If CI fails:**
- Check that all dependencies in `pyproject.toml` are correct
- Verify Python version compatibility
- Review error logs in GitHub Actions tab

**If releases fail:**
- Verify `PYPI_API_TOKEN` is correctly set
- Check PyPI project name availability
- Ensure version numbers follow semantic versioning

**For shell completions:**
- Run `./install-completions.sh` after installation
- Restart your shell or source your shell configuration
- Test with `ado <TAB><TAB>`

## ðŸ“ž Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check the `github-workflows-template/README.md` for detailed instructions
2. Review the GitHub Actions documentation
3. Open an issue in the repository for help

This manual setup is a one-time requirement due to GitHub's security model for workflow management.
