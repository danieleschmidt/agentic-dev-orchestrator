# 🔒 Security Policy

We take security seriously at Agentic Development Orchestrator (ADO). This document outlines our security practices, vulnerability reporting process, and security guidelines for users and contributors.

## 🚨 Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

**IMPORTANT**: For sensitive security vulnerabilities, please use private reporting methods rather than public issues.

### 🔐 Private Reporting Methods (Recommended)
1. **GitHub Security Advisories** (Preferred): [Report privately](https://github.com/terragon-labs/agentic-dev-orchestrator/security/advisories/new)
2. **Security Email**: security@terragonlabs.com
3. **Encrypted Communication**: PGP key available on request

### 🚫 What NOT to Report Publicly
- Authentication bypasses
- Code injection vulnerabilities  
- Information disclosure issues
- Privilege escalation problems
- Any issue that could compromise user systems

### ✅ What CAN be Reported Publicly
- Documentation improvements
- Configuration hardening suggestions
- Non-exploitable security enhancements
- General security questions

## 📞 Contact Information

**Primary Security Contact**: security@terragonlabs.com
**Backup Contact**: hello@terragonlabs.com
**GitHub Security**: Use [Security Advisories](https://github.com/terragon-labs/agentic-dev-orchestrator/security/advisories)

## ⏰ Response Timeline

| Action | Timeline |
|--------|----------|
| **Initial Acknowledgment** | Within 48 hours |
| **Detailed Response** | Within 7 days |
| **Severity Assessment** | Within 7 days |
| **Fix Development** | Based on severity (see below) |
| **Public Disclosure** | After fix is available |

### 🎯 Fix Timeline by Severity
- **Critical** (9.0-10.0 CVSS): 24-72 hours
- **High** (7.0-8.9 CVSS): 7 days
- **Medium** (4.0-6.9 CVSS): 30 days
- **Low** (0.1-3.9 CVSS): Next release cycle

## 📋 Supported Versions

| Version | Supported | End of Life |
|---------|-----------|-------------|
| 0.1.x   | ✅ Yes    | TBD |
| < 0.1   | ❌ No     | Immediately |

**Security Update Policy**:
- Security patches are provided for the latest minor version
- Critical vulnerabilities may receive backports to previous minor versions
- EOL versions receive no security updates

## 🛡️ Security Measures

### 🔍 Automated Security Scanning
- **Dependency Scanning**: Daily automated scans for vulnerable dependencies
- **Static Analysis**: Bandit, Semgrep, and custom security rules
- **Secret Detection**: GitHub Secret Scanning and detect-secrets
- **Container Scanning**: Trivy for Docker image vulnerabilities
- **SAST**: CodeQL analysis on all code changes

### 🔐 Secure Development Practices
- **Security Code Review**: All PRs undergo security review
- **Pre-commit Hooks**: Security tools run before every commit
- **Dependency Pinning**: All dependencies pinned to specific versions
- **Minimal Permissions**: Principle of least privilege throughout
- **Input Validation**: All user inputs validated and sanitized

### 🏗️ Infrastructure Security
- **GitHub Security Features**: Advanced Security enabled
- **Branch Protection**: Required reviews and status checks
- **Supply Chain Security**: SLSA compliance and SBOM generation
- **Secrets Management**: GitHub Secrets for sensitive data
- **Access Control**: Two-factor authentication required

## 🎯 Security Guidelines for Users

### 🔑 Environment Security
```bash
# Use environment variables for sensitive data
export GITHUB_TOKEN="your_token_here"
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_key_here"

# Never commit secrets to repositories
echo "*.env" >> .gitignore
echo ".env.*" >> .gitignore
```

### 🐳 Container Security
```bash
# Run containers with limited privileges
docker run --user 1000:1000 --read-only ado:latest

# Use specific tags, not 'latest'
docker run ghcr.io/terragon-labs/agentic-dev-orchestrator:v0.1.0
```

### 📝 Configuration Security
- **API Keys**: Store in environment variables, never in config files
- **File Permissions**: Restrict config file access (600 or 644)
- **Network Access**: Limit outbound connections when possible
- **Logging**: Avoid logging sensitive information

## 🔍 Security Testing

### 🧪 Running Security Tests
```bash
# Install security dependencies
pip install -e ".[security]"

# Run security scans
bandit -r . -x tests/
safety check
pip-audit
semgrep --config=auto .

# Run security-focused tests
pytest tests/security/ -v
```

### 🎯 Security Test Coverage
- Authentication and authorization testing
- Input validation and sanitization
- Error handling and information disclosure
- Configuration security
- Dependency vulnerability testing
