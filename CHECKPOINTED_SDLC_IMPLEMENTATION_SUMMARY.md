## 🚨 Manual Setup Requirements

Due to GitHub App permission limitations, the following require manual setup:

### 1. GitHub Actions Workflows
Copy workflow files from `docs/workflows/examples/` to `.github/workflows/`:
```bash
cp docs/workflows/examples/*.yml .github/workflows/
```

### 2. Repository Secrets
Configure in GitHub Settings > Secrets:
- `PYPI_API_TOKEN`: For package publishing
- `TEST_PYPI_API_TOKEN`: For test publishing
- `SEMGREP_APP_TOKEN`: For advanced security scanning
- `SNYK_TOKEN`: For container vulnerability scanning

### 3. Branch Protection Rules
Configure in GitHub Settings > Branches:
- Require PR reviews (minimum 1)
- Require status checks: `Run Tests`, `Security Scanning`, `Build Package`
- Require branches to be up to date
- Include administrators

### 4. Environment Configuration
Create "production" environment with:
- Required reviewers for deployments
- Deployment branch restrictions (main and tags only)
